## Course description
This course will demonstrate and practice the use of R in creating and presenting data visualizations. After a short introduction to R tools, especially the tidyverse packages, we will look at good principles for data visualization, examples of good and bad visualizations, and the use of ggplot2 to create static publication-quality graphs. We will also explore modern web-based interactive graphics using the htmlwidgets packages as well as dynamic graphics and dashboards that can be created using flexdashboard and Shiny. We will explore ways in which bioinformatics data can be presented using static and dynamic visualizations. Finally, we will use RMarkdown and several packages to develop web pages for presenting data visualizations as self-explanatory, and possibly interactive, storyboards. 

## Learning objectives

- Understand principles of good data visualization; avoid poor or inappropriate data visualization
- Practical short introduction to R to enable data visualization; Manipulating data to enable good visualizations
-	Appropriate use of color, symbols and small multiples
-	Static and dynamic data visualizations
-	Using the web as a presentation medium
