We will cover the entire data analytics pipeline from data ingestion to data wrangling, summarizing, modeling, visualizing and reporting, all using tools found within the R ecosystem. The version of these notes you are reading now was built on 2019-05-02. To raise an issue about the note’s content (e.g., code not running) or to make a feature request, check out the issue tracker.

["reproducibility.html", "Reproducibility", " Reproducibility These notes are written with bookdown, a R package for writing books using rmarkdown. All code in these notes were developed on R version 3.5.3 (2019-03-11), using the same packages pre-installed in your virtual machines. When you’re on your own, you will need to install a recent version of R, and also install the corresponding packages, on your computer, for all the code to work. A listing of all the packages used in this course will be available as an appendix. To build these notes locally, clone or download the Github repo hosting these notes, unzip it if necessary, and double-click on FSI_Book.Rproj. Assuming you have RStudio installed, this will open this project (more on RStudio Projects later). You can then go to the console and enter the following code:{r, eval = F} bookdown::render_book(&quot;index.Rmd&quot;) # to build these notes browseURL(&quot;_book/index.html&quot;) # to view it "],

These will reside in the RStudio Cloud project for that assignment. We’ll be able to see and check them there. Do not e-mail me anything Homework assignments are due back to me by the following Tuesday at midnight. The instructional team will check the timestamp of the file. You may be late on at most 1 homework out of the 6 homeworks that will be assigned. Homeworks will count for 50% of your grade. 1.1.0.1 Collaboration "],
