```{r, include = FALSE, eval = knitr::opts_knit$get("rmarkdown.pandoc.to") == "html"}
# Enables Font Awesome in HTML based bookdown outputs.
fa <- rmarkdown::html_dependency_font_awesome()
fa$attachment <- "fonts/fontawesome-webfont.ttf"
htmltools::tagList(fa)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Lecture One (April 3, 2019)

In this lecture, we'll start a discussion about data visualization. We will also start using R and R Markdown on RStudio Cloud. 
We will work on a template notebook that I've shared with you on RStudio Cloud, and you can expand on that during class and as we 
move through the course.
