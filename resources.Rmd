# Web resources

- [Flowing Data](https://www.flowingdata.com): This is one of my favorite sites for learning data viz. There are several [tutorials](https://flowingdata.com/category/tutorials/) in R for different graphics, as well as other languages. Nathan Yau, who runs the website, also has 2 excellent [books](https://flowingdata.com/books/) on data viz, as well as a few self-guided [courses](https://flowingdata.com/courses/) for data viz in R.
- [JunkCharts](https://junkcharts.typepad.com): Critiques of chartjunk + junk art
